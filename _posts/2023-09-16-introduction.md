## What is jBPM?
[jBPM] is a business automation tool for automating business processes with ease and providing accessibility through REST APIs and comprehensive documentation for said APIs. Optionally, with jBPM as a foundation, we can also build our own powerful applications and tools to personalise our experience. One of these applications include [qBPM].

## What is qBPM?
[qBPM] is a demonstrative web application for showcasing how [jBPM] can be used to create powerful tools through smooth integrations with various open source technologies. 

## Purpose of this documentation
This documentation will be dedicated to walking you through how you can set up a [jBPM] server, customise it to fit your needs, utilise [jBPM] to create automated processes, and integrate them with [qBPM], our own custom webapp for presenting these automated processes.

## What will we be creating in this walkthrough?
We will be using jBPM to create a work-from-home request portal to automate the process of requesting to work from home. This will help ease the lives of our HR team as well as our employees.

## Prerequisites
* [Installation of jBPM Server Distribution](https://www.jbpm.org/download/community.html)
* [Node.js LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
* [Postgres setup](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
   * Only install the setup and do not open it yet unless you know what you're doing as I will be guiding you through this due to important configurations you need to follow for qBPM to work.
* [JDK 17](https://www.oracle.com/uk/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk17-windows)
* [Stable version of Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
	* Apache Maven allows us to build our qBPM application by installing the neccessary dependencies.
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

> I recommend that you watch a video or read an article on how to install each software listed above(*aside from jBPM as it's just a straightforward zip file*) as they will guide you through the installation process step by step. As a beginner it can be confusing when you see all the cryptic installation configurations.

> #### Note
> Every process mentioned in this documentation is based on my experience with Windows 10, so do keep in mind that results may vary from operating system to operating system.
