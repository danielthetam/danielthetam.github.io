If SpringBoot produces an error that states that the port is in use, that means you have to navigate back to the `application.properties` file and change the server port to any open port on your device. 

In the case that any other errors come up, do attempt to search it up as setup will differ from environment to environment, or as a last resort, you may contact me from [my website](https://danieltam.com/contact).
