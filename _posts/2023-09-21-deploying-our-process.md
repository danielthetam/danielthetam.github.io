## Deploying our project
Before we deploy our project, we need to generate the forms required for our process. To do this, head into our `request-portal` process, click on the form button(form icon to the left of the Download button), and click `Generate all forms`. This will generate all dedicated forms for our business process. Once generated, we should see some new form assets in our project. 

Now, head over to the form named `WFHRequest-Portal.request-portal-taskform`. This is our main process form and it is what is shown to our employee who starts the process instance to submit a request. By default, the form generates fields for all process variables, but we only want the employee to fill up the `employee` and `request` process variables. Therefore, we may remove all other fields besides those two by clicking on the vertical ellipsis icon and clicking remove.

Once complete, we can exit to the project explorer and hit `Deploy` to deploy our project. 

## Testing our project
