      Starting the jBPM Server
Once we have installed jBPM and unzipped its contents, we can begin by navigating to the ‘bin’ folder and running ‘standalone.bat’. This will get the jBPM server up and running.

  It may take a while for the server to st...

      Creating Data Objects
Now, we will begin adding our assets. First, let’s clarify what objects we’d need for our request portal. The best way to do this is to visualise our process by creating a scenario and analysing it.

In our portal, we’ll have an actor who submits a request, groups of actors who process the request and a final actor who decides whether the request is approved or not. Ultima...
