      Deploying our project
Before we deploy our project, we need to generate the forms required for our process. To do this, head into our request-portal process, click on the form button(form icon to the left of the Download button), and click Generate all forms. This will generate all dedicated forms for our business process. Once generated, we should see some new form assets in our project. Now, ...

  High-level summary on how a process works
  There are two terms that we’d ought to familiarise ourselves with here. One being process definition, and the other process instance. Currently, we are creating a process definition, which can be thought of as a base blueprint for a process instance. There can be multiple process instances, which are created(or more properly-termed ‘instantiated’) ...

      Creating Data Objects
Now, we will begin adding our assets. First, let’s clarify what objects we’d need for our request portal. The best way to do this is to visualise our process by creating a scenario and analysing it.

In our portal, we’ll have an actor who submits a request, groups of actors who process the request and a final actor who decides whether the request is approved or not. Ultima...

      Starting the jBPM Server
Once we have installed jBPM and unzipped its contents, we can begin by navigating to the ‘bin’ folder and running ‘standalone.bat’. This will get the jBPM server up and running. Once the server is up, navigate to Business Central(“https://localhost:8080/business-central/”) where we’ll be met by the Business Central login page.
