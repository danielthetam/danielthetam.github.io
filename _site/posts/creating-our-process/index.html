<meta name="description" content="High-level summary on how a process works There are two terms that we’d ought to familiarise ourselves with here. One being process definition, and the other process instance. Currently, we are creating a process definition, which can be thought of as a base blueprint for a process instance. There can be multiple process instances, which are created(or more properly-termed ‘instantiated’) when the employee wants to submit a request. Each instance is different from each other and may end with varying results. This is primarily reliant on differences in process variables that are defined by user input(like our employee and request variable that needs to be filled up by the requester) as well as outputs from functions executed along the flow. Now, we shall design the business process and define its flow. Because this is a demo application, we’ll keep things simple instead of creating overwhelmingly complex processes. Scenario Reference In our portal, we’ll have an actor who submits a request, groups of actors who process the request and a final actor who decides whether the request is approved or not. Ultimately, all of these actors are employees, so that can be declared as an object of itself. Then, we also have the request object, which should contain information about the request made by the first actor. Our goal now is to turn the above thoughts into action. Let’s start off by adding a new business process asset into the project and naming it ‘request-portal’. Below is a reference image and a spoiler for what our business process will look like at the end of the day. ADD REFERENCE IMAGE Submission Stage From the above scenario reference, we know that our process involves these three stages: submission, processing and a final approval. To represent submission(i.e the start of the process), we will drag a start node(the plain green circle) into our editor space. Processing Stages Now, in the processing stage, we can break it down into two sub-stages: manual filtering by Processing Officers, and the assignment of the appropriate department manager by a Human Resources team. Creating our user task nodes Since these are tasks assigned to human users, let’s click on the Activities button(can be identified by a plain rounded rectangle on the menu of nodes on the left) and drag in a User node. Then we connect the start node to it. Nodes can be connected together by clicking on the preceding node, selecting the solid arrow icon and dragging it towards the following node. Click on the User node and edit its name to “Manual Filtering” in the Properties window on the right. If there doesn’t appear to be any window, click on the pencil-paper icon on the upper right corner to expand it. Then, we drag in another User node, and we then name it “Department Manager Assignment”. Implementing conditions with a BPMN gateway Before connecting the two, we need a BPMN(Business Process Model and Notation) gateway, which can be thought of as a logic gate which helps us implement conditional statements in our process. This gateway is needed to split our results into two cases based on the output of Manual Filtering sub-stage. One being an approval from Processing Officers where it will lead to the next sub-stage(assignment of department manager), and another where it is rejected, and leads to an early-ending and a notice email of rejection to the employee. A list of gateways and what they generally perform can be found here. Let’s click on the Gateways button and drag an “Exclusive” gateway in between our two task nodes, and connect the Manual Filtering node to our gateway. The gateway should then branch out into two paths, but for now, we’ll just connect it to our Department Manager Assignment node. Creating our process variables Now, we need to define a condition for when the gateway should allow the flow to pass through this branch. We know our condition is that the Processing Officer has to approve of the validity of our request in order for it to pass. Therefore to evaluate this, we need some variable that indicates whether the Processing Officers approve of it or not. This is where Process Variables come into play. In order to edit process variables, click on the upper right pencil-paper icon to edit the properties of our process. Note: If you can’t see any process properties Ensure that you haven’t selected any nodes, otherwise it’d display the properties of that node instead of the process properties. To de-select a node, just click away from it. Configuring our Manual Filtering node Then, scroll down and click on Process Data to expand the list, and there we can edit our process variables. Process variables are variables that we need to keep track of globally throughout the execution of the process. In order to indicate whether the Processing Officer has accepted it, we can create a variable of type boolean named hasBeenValidated. The value of this variable will be decided by Processing Officers in the Manual Filtering task node. Our user task node can be thought of as a manually-driven function. In order to output something, our Processing Officers will need some input parameters to base their output decision on. This will of course be the employee object and the request object. They need to know who exactly made the request, and the details of their request in order to validate it. Therefore, we shall establish these as process variables as well. Add another variable named employee of data type Employee which represents the employee who submitted the request. Then, add another variable named request of data type Request, which represents the request the employee has submitted. At the end of the day, these two variables will be filled up in a form by the employee looking to submit a request to work from home. Now, click on our Manual Filtering node, and expand Implementation/Execution. Fill in the following details: Task Name: manualFiltering Subject: Conduct manual filtering for #{employee.name}&#39;s request Any content written in #{} is treated as a FEEL(Friendly Enough Expression Language) statement. In this case, this statement will refer to our employee process variable and its name field, which is a field we established when we created the Employee data object. So if the employee’s name is James, #{employee.name} will be replaced with ‘James’. Groups: ManualFilters This is where groups come into play. We can assign our user task to groups of users or even specific actors with the above Actors tab. Assignments: Data Inputs And Assignments(These are the input parameters given to our Processing Officers, who are part of the ManualFilters group): Name: employee; Data Type: com.myspace.wfhrequest_portal.Employee; Source: employee Name: request; Data Type: com.myspace.wfhrequest_portal.Request; Source: request Data Outputs And Assignments(These is the output decision that will be manually filled by our Processing Officer) Name: hasBeenValidated; Data Type: Boolean; Source: hasBeenValidated Configuring our Department Manager Assigment node Then, add another variable named manager, which will be the output of our Department Manager Assignment task node.

  <h2 id="high-level-summary-on-how-a-process-works"><span class="me-2"><em>High-level summary on how a process works</em></span><a href="#high-level-summary-on-how-a-process-works" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2>
  <p>There are two terms that we’d ought to familiarise ourselves with here. One being <strong>process definition</strong>, and the other <strong>process instance</strong>. Currently, we are creating a process definition, which can be thought of as a base blueprint for a process instance. There can be multiple process instances, which are created(or more properly-termed ‘instantiated’) when the employee wants to submit a request. Each instance is different from each other and may end with varying results. This is primarily reliant on differences in process variables that are defined by user input(like our <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">employee</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">request</code> variable that needs to be filled up by the requester) as well as outputs from functions executed along the flow.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, we shall design the business process and define its flow. Because this is a demo application, we’ll keep things simple instead of creating overwhelmingly complex processes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <h2 id="scenario-reference"><span class="me-2"><em>Scenario Reference</em></span><a href="#scenario-reference" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2>
  <p>In our portal, we’ll have an actor who submits a request, groups of actors who process the request and a final actor who decides whether the request is approved or not. Ultimately, all of these actors are employees, so that can be declared as an object of itself. Then, we also have the request object, which should contain information about the request made by the first actor.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Our goal now is to turn the above thoughts into action. Let’s start off by adding a new business process asset into the project and naming it ‘request-portal’. Below is a reference image and a spoiler for what our business process will look like at the end of the day.</p>

<p>ADD REFERENCE IMAGE</p>

<h2 id="submission-stage"><span class="me-2">Submission Stage</span><a href="#submission-stage" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2>
<p>From the above scenario reference, we know that our process involves these three stages: submission, processing and a final approval. To represent submission(i.e the start of the process), we will drag a start node(the plain green circle) into our editor space.</p>

<h2 id="processing-stages"><span class="me-2">Processing Stages</span><a href="#processing-stages" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2>
<p>Now, in the processing stage, we can break it down into two sub-stages: manual filtering by Processing Officers, and the assignment of the appropriate department manager by a Human Resources team.</p>

<h3 id="creating-our-user-task-nodes"><span class="me-2">Creating our user task nodes</span><a href="#creating-our-user-task-nodes" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3>
<p>Since these are tasks assigned to human users, let’s click on the Activities button(can be identified by a plain rounded rectangle on the menu of nodes on the left) and drag in a User node. Then we connect the start node to it. Nodes can be connected together by clicking on the preceding node, selecting the solid arrow icon and dragging it towards the following node. Click on the User node and edit its name to “Manual Filtering” in the Properties window on the right.</p>

<p>If there doesn’t appear to be any window, click on the pencil-paper icon on the upper right corner to expand it.</p>

<p>Then, we drag in another User node, and we then name it “Department Manager Assignment”.</p>

<h3 id="implementing-conditions-with-a-bpmn-gateway"><span class="me-2">Implementing conditions with a BPMN gateway</span><a href="#implementing-conditions-with-a-bpmn-gateway" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3>
<p>Before connecting the two, we need a BPMN(Business Process Model and Notation) gateway, which can be thought of as a logic gate which helps us implement conditional statements in our process. This gateway is needed to split our results into two cases based on the output of Manual Filtering sub-stage. One being an approval from Processing Officers where it will lead to the next sub-stage(assignment of department manager), and another where it is rejected, and leads to an early-ending and a notice email of rejection to the employee. A list of gateways and what they generally perform can be found <a href="https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/bpmn-symbols-explained#section_4">here</a>.</p>

<p>Let’s click on the Gateways button and drag an “Exclusive” gateway in between our two task nodes, and connect the Manual Filtering node to our gateway. The gateway should then branch out into two paths, but for now, we’ll just connect it to our Department Manager Assignment node.</p>

<h3 id="creating-our-process-variables"><span class="me-2">Creating our process variables</span><a href="#creating-our-process-variables" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3>
<p>Now, we need to define a condition for when the gateway should allow the flow to pass through this branch. We know our condition is that the Processing Officer has to approve of the validity of our request in order for it to pass. Therefore to evaluate this, we need some variable that indicates whether the Processing Officers approve of it or not. This is where Process Variables come into play.</p>

<p>In order to edit process variables, click on the upper right pencil-paper icon to edit the properties of our process.</p>

<blockquote>
  <h4 id="note-if-you-cant-see-any-process-properties"><span class="me-2"><em>Note: If you can’t see any process properties</em></span><a href="#note-if-you-cant-see-any-process-properties" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h4>
  <p>Ensure that you haven’t selected any nodes, otherwise it’d display the properties of that node instead of the process properties. To de-select a node, just click away from it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="configuring-our-manual-filtering-node"><span class="me-2">Configuring our Manual Filtering node</span><a href="#configuring-our-manual-filtering-node" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h4>
<p>Then, scroll down and click on Process Data to expand the list, and there we can edit our process variables. Process variables are variables that we need to keep track of globally throughout the execution of the process. In order to indicate whether the Processing Officer has accepted it, we can create a variable of type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">boolean</code> named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hasBeenValidated</code>. The value of this variable will be decided by Processing Officers in the Manual Filtering task node.</p>

<p>Our user task node can be thought of as a manually-driven function. In order to output something, our Processing Officers will need some input parameters to base their output decision on. This will of course be the employee object and the request object. They need to know who exactly made the request, and the details of their request in order to validate it. Therefore, we shall establish these as process variables as well.</p>

<p>Add another variable named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">employee</code> of data type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Employee</code> which represents the employee who submitted the request. Then, add another variable named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">request</code> of data type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Request</code>, which represents the request the employee has submitted. At the end of the day, these two variables will be filled up in a form by the employee looking to submit a request to work from home.</p>

<p>Now, click on our Manual Filtering node, and expand Implementation/Execution. Fill in the following details:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Task Name: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">manualFiltering</code></li>
  <li>Subject: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Conduct manual filtering for #{employee.name}'s request</code>
    <ul>
      <li>Any content written in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#{}</code> is treated as a FEEL(Friendly Enough Expression Language) statement. In this case, this statement will refer to our employee process variable and its <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">name</code> field, which is a field we established when we created the Employee data object. So if the employee’s name is James, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#{employee.name}</code> will be replaced with ‘James’.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Groups: ManualFilters
    <ul>
      <li>This is where groups come into play. We can assign our user task to groups of users or even specific actors with the above Actors tab.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Assignments:
    <ul>
      <li>Data Inputs And Assignments(These are the input parameters given to our Processing Officers, who are part of the ManualFilters group):
        <ul>
          <li>Name: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">employee</code>; Data Type: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">com.myspace.wfhrequest_portal.Employee</code>; Source: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">employee</code></li>
          <li>Name: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">request</code>; Data Type: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">com.myspace.wfhrequest_portal.Request</code>; Source: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">request</code></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Data Outputs And Assignments(These is the output decision that will be manually filled by our Processing Officer)
        <ul>
          <li>Name: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hasBeenValidated</code>; Data Type: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Boolean</code>; Source: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hasBeenValidated</code></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
